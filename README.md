- Don't forget to follow [@Anandsg](https://github.com/Anandsg) ‚≠êüòä

And yes it is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Anandsg/Hacktoberfest-2023)
on GitHub.

## Contributing for the first time? :

- Refer to <a href="https://github.com/Anandsg/Hacktoberfest-2023/main/GUIDE.md">[Steps to Contribute](#crt)</a><br>

# Guidelines üö¶ :

Before pushing code please go through our guidelines:

1. Always push the code in the specified folder.
2. Mention proper name for the code before making PR.
3. Repetetive Pull Requests with same code in the same language won't be counted and will be marked as spam.
4. If you want to push the code in some other language which is not present in this repo, make a seperate folder with language name and then push it.
5. Explain your code with proper comments along with problem statement(especially for DSA). It's better if you can write time and space complexities.

# <a name="crt"></a> How to Contribute?

### **Contribute First, Think Later.**

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone <url>
```

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd Hacktoberfest-2023
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-Anandsg
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add Vasu to Contributors.md"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
